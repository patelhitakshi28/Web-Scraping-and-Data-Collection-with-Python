# Web-Scraping-and-Data-Collection-with-Python
This project demonstrates web scraping and data collection techniques using Python's BeautifulSoup and pandas libraries. The script extracts data from a real website, processes it, and stores it in a structured format (CSV file) for further analysis.

# Features:

1. Web Scraping: Utilized BeautifulSoup to parse and extract meaningful information from the website's HTML content.
2. Data Cleaning: Applied pandas for data manipulation and organization.
3. CSV Storage: Stored the scraped data in a CSV file for easy access and further usage.

# Why should we use Pandas and Beautifulsoup libraries ??

1. Pandas is essential for managing and analyzing the scraped data.
  - Data Organization: It allows the data to be structured in a tabular format using DataFrames, making it easy to understand and work with.
  - Data Cleaning: Provides robust tools for cleaning and transforming raw data (e.g., handling missing values, renaming columns, etc.).
  - Analysis: Enables quick analysis of the data with built-in functions like filtering, sorting, and grouping.
  - Storage: Makes it simple to save the processed data to files, such as CSV, Excel, or JSON, for further use.

2. BeautifulSoup: Parsing and Navgating HTML
